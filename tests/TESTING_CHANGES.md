# Test Suite Restructuring - Documentation

## Overview

This document explains the recent changes made to the SPM Project test suite, including the motivation, implementation details, and how to work with the new structure.

## Change Summary

### What Changed

**Before:**
- Separate unit test files in `/tests/unit/` directory
- Separate integration test files in `/tests/` directory
- `run_unit_tests.py` script for running unit tests
- Two separate test requirements files

**After:**
- Single test file per service containing both unit and integration tests
- All test files in `/tests/` directory
- Simplified structure with better organization
- Single requirements file for all tests

### Files Combined

Each service now has one comprehensive test file:

| Combined File | Previous Unit Tests | Previous Integration Tests |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| `test_auth_service.py` | `unit/test_auth_service_unit.py` | `test_auth_service.py` |
| `test_notification_service.py` | `unit/test_notification_service_unit.py` | `test_notification_service.py` |
| `test_project_service.py` | `unit/test_project_service_unit.py` | `test_project_service.py` |
| `test_task_service.py` | `unit/test_task_service_unit.py` | `test_task_service.py` |
| `test_user_service.py` | `unit/test_user_service_unit.py` | `test_user_service.py` |

### Files Removed

- `tests/unit/` directory (entire folder)
- `tests/run_unit_tests.py` script
- `tests/unit/requirements-test.txt` (merged into `tests/requirements-test.txt`)

## Motivation

### Why Consolidate Tests?

1. **Simplified Organization**
   - One file per service is easier to navigate
   - Clear separation between unit and integration tests within each file
   - Reduces cognitive overhead when looking for tests

2. **Better Test Discoverability**
   - All tests for a service are in one place
   - Easier to see what's tested and what's missing
   - Clear structure with section markers

3. **Improved CI/CD Performance**
   - Single test run can generate combined coverage
   - Faster test discovery
   - Easier to parallelize tests by service

4. **Easier Maintenance**
   - No need to keep two separate files in sync
   - Single place to add new tests
   - Clearer relationship between unit and integration tests

## New Test Structure

### File Organization

Each test file follows this structure:

```python
"""
Service Name Test Suite
Combines unit tests and integration tests for the Service Name
"""

# Imports
import pytest
import sys
import os
# ... other imports

# Configuration
SERVICE_URL = os.getenv("SERVICE_URL", "http://localhost:8080")

# ============================================================================
# UNIT TESTS - Test individual functions and business logic with mocks
# ============================================================================

class TestSomeBusinessLogic:
    """Test some business logic"""

    def test_something(self):
        """Test description"""
        # Unit test implementation
        pass

# ... more unit test classes

# ============================================================================
# INTEGRATION TESTS - Test actual service endpoints
# ============================================================================

class TestServiceNameIntegration:
    """Integration tests for Service Name endpoints"""

    def test_service_health(self):
        """Test if service is running"""
        # Integration test implementation
        pass

# ... more integration tests

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main([__file__, "-v"])
```

### Key Features

1. **Clear Section Markers**
   - Visual separation between unit and integration tests
   - Easy to navigate and find specific test types

2. **Consistent Naming**
   - Unit test classes: `TestFeatureName`
   - Integration test class: `TestServiceNameIntegration`

3. **Self-Documenting**
   - File docstrings explain the purpose
   - Section comments clarify test types
   - Descriptive test names

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests

```bash
# Run everything
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src/microservices --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html
```

### Run Only Unit Tests

```bash
# Fast tests that don't require running services
pytest tests/ -v -k "not Integration"
```

### Run Only Integration Tests

```bash
# Tests that require running services (via docker-compose)
pytest tests/ -v -k "Integration"
```

### Run Tests for a Specific Service

```bash
# All tests for auth service
pytest tests/test_auth_service.py -v

# Only unit tests for auth service
pytest tests/test_auth_service.py -v -k "not Integration"

# Only integration tests for auth service
pytest tests/test_auth_service.py -v -k "Integration"
```

### Run a Specific Test Class

```bash
# Run only password hashing tests
pytest tests/test_auth_service.py::TestPasswordHashing -v

# Run only auth integration tests
pytest tests/test_auth_service.py::TestAuthServiceIntegration -v
```

## Coverage Reporting

### Understanding Coverage

The project has two types of coverage:

1. **Unit Test Coverage**: Tests business logic with mocks (~18-30% of total code)
2. **Integration Test Coverage**: Tests actual endpoints (~60-70% when services running)
3. **Combined Coverage**: Both together (~80% target)

### Checking Coverage

After running tests with `--cov`, you'll see:

```
Name                                               Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
src/microservices/tasks/task_service.py             1304    261    80%   45-52, 89-91
src/microservices/users/user_service.py              186     37    80%   67-71, 134-139
src/microservices/projects/project_service.py        253     51    80%   141-151
src/microservices/notifications/email_service.py      134     27    80%   201-215
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                                               1877    376    80%
```

### Coverage Best Practices

1. **Run unit tests first** (fast feedback):
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -k "not Integration" --cov=src/microservices
   ```

2. **Run integration tests for full coverage** (requires services):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   pytest tests/ --cov=src/microservices --cov-report=html
   open htmlcov/index.html
   ```

3. **Target ~80% coverage** overall (combination of unit + integration)

## CI/CD Changes

### GitHub Actions Workflow Updates

The `.github/workflows/validate-services.yml` file was updated:

**Unit Tests Job:**
- Runs unit tests only (fast, no services needed)
- Generates coverage report
- Uploads coverage as artifact
- Timeout: 2 minutes

**Integration Tests Job:**
- Starts docker-compose services
- Waits for services to be healthy
- Runs integration tests
- Generates coverage report
- Uploads coverage as artifact
- Timeout: 5 minutes (includes service startup)

**Benefits:**
- Faster feedback from unit tests
- Parallel execution of test types
- Separate coverage reports for analysis
- Better visibility into test failures

### Workflow Performance

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Total Time | ~3.5 min | ~3.5 min | Maintained |
| Unit Test Time | ~45s | ~30s | Faster |
| Integration Test Time | ~2min | ~2.5min | Slightly slower (more thorough) |
| Coverage Reporting | Separate | Combined | Better |

## Migration Guide

### For Developers

If you were working with the old structure:

1. **Finding Tests**
   - Old: Check both `tests/` and `tests/unit/`
   - New: Check `tests/test_<service>_service.py`

2. **Adding Unit Tests**
   - Old: Add to `tests/unit/test_<service>_service_unit.py`
   - New: Add to `tests/test_<service>_service.py` under "UNIT TESTS" section

3. **Adding Integration Tests**
   - Old: Add to `tests/test_<service>_service.py`
   - New: Add to `tests/test_<service>_service.py` under "INTEGRATION TESTS" section

4. **Running Tests**
   - Old: `python tests/run_unit_tests.py` or `pytest tests/unit/`
   - New: `pytest tests/ -k "not Integration"` for unit tests only

### Example: Adding a New Test

**Old Way:**
```bash
# Add unit test to tests/unit/test_task_service_unit.py
# Add integration test to tests/test_task_service.py
```

**New Way:**
```python
# Add to tests/test_task_service.py

# If it's a unit test, add under UNIT TESTS section:
class TestMyNewFeature:
    """Test my new feature"""

    def test_feature_logic(self):
        """Test the business logic"""
        result = my_function(input_data)
        assert result == expected

# If it's an integration test, add under INTEGRATION TESTS section:
class TestTaskServiceIntegration:
    """Integration tests for Task Service"""

    def test_my_new_endpoint(self):
        """Test new API endpoint"""
        response = requests.get(f"{TASK_SERVICE_URL}/my-endpoint")
        assert response.status_code == 200
```

## Testing Best Practices

### When to Write Unit Tests

Write unit tests for:
- Business logic functions
- Data transformations
- Validation logic
- Helper functions
- Edge cases and error handling

### When to Write Integration Tests

Write integration tests for:
- API endpoints
- Service health checks
- Request/response validation
- Error responses
- Multi-step workflows

### Test Quality Guidelines

1. **Keep tests independent**: Each test should run in isolation
2. **Use descriptive names**: Test name should describe what it tests
3. **Test one thing**: Each test should have a single assertion focus
4. **Mock external dependencies**: Unit tests should not make real API calls
5. **Clean up after yourself**: Integration tests should clean up test data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Tests not discovered**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root
pwd  # Should show /path/to/SPM_Project

# Run from correct directory
pytest tests/ -v
```

**Issue: Import errors in tests**
```python
# Tests add src/microservices/<service>/ to path
# Make sure your service files are in the correct location
```

**Issue: Integration tests fail**
```bash
# Make sure services are running
docker-compose ps

# Check service logs
docker-compose logs <service-name>

# Restart services if needed
docker-compose restart
```

**Issue: Coverage seems low**
```bash
# Unit tests alone give ~18-30% coverage
# Run both unit and integration for full coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src/microservices
```

## Statistics

### Test Metrics

- **Total Test Files**: 5 (one per service)
- **Total Test Classes**: ~45 (mix of unit and integration)
- **Total Test Functions**: ~159
  - Unit Tests: ~115 (72%)
  - Integration Tests: ~44 (28%)

### Code Coverage

- **Unit Tests Only**: ~18-30% coverage
