# Solution for Two Issues

## Issue #1: No Comment Notifications

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ Debug logging added to code
- ‚úÖ Code committed (f63db8a)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to verify Docker rebuilt with new code
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to see actual logs when commenting

### Next Steps for You

**CRITICAL: We need to see the logs!**

1. Open terminal and run:
```bash
docker compose logs -f task-service
```

2. Post a comment on any task

3. Look for these lines:
   - `üîî Attempting to send comment notifications`
   - `üîî NOTIFY_TASK_COMMENT CALLED`
   - `üë• Stakeholders found:`
   - `‚úÖ SUCCESS: Notification inserted!`

4. **Share the complete log output with me**

Without seeing the logs, I can't diagnose the exact problem. The logs will show:
- If the function is being called
- If stakeholders are found
- If database inserts succeed
- Any error messages

## Issue #2: Collaborators Not Showing on Home Page

### Problem Identified

You said:
- ‚úÖ Collaborators show in popup from notification inbox
- ‚ùå Collaborators don't show in popup from home page

Both use the same `TaskDetailModal` component, but they might be passing different data.

### Root Cause

Looking at your debug output:
```javascript
collaborators: Array(2)  // Shows collaborators exist in the data
```

The task data HAS collaborators, but `TaskDetailModal` might not be receiving them or displaying them correctly.

### Let me check TaskDetailModal...
