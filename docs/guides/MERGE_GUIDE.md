# Safe Merge Guide: fix/comment-notifications â†’ main

## Current Situation
- **Current Branch**: `fix/comment-notifications`
- **Status**: Working tree clean (all changes already committed)
- **Goal**: Safely merge your notification fixes into main while preserving all new features from main

## Strategy: Merge main INTO feature branch first
This is the SAFE way! We resolve conflicts on the feature branch, not on main.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Commit any remaining changes (if needed)
```bash
cd /Users/zenia/Documents/GitHub/SPM_Project

# Check status
git status

# If you want to include ALL_FIXES_COMPLETE.md in your commit
git add ALL_FIXES_COMPLETE.md
git commit -m "docs: Add documentation for notification fixes"

# Otherwise, you can delete it or leave it untracked
# rm ALL_FIXES_COMPLETE.md
```

### Step 2: Fetch latest changes from remote
```bash
# This downloads the latest changes without modifying your files
git fetch origin

# Check what's different between your main and remote main
git log main..origin/main --oneline
```

### Step 3: Update your local main branch
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull the latest changes from remote
git pull origin main

# This will update your local main with all the new features
```

### Step 4: Go back to your feature branch
```bash
git checkout fix/comment-notifications
```

### Step 5: Merge main INTO your feature branch
```bash
# This brings all the new features from main into your branch
# Conflicts will appear HERE (on your feature branch, not main)
git merge main

# If there are conflicts, you'll see a message like:
# "CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in <filename>"
```

### Step 6: Resolve conflicts (if any)

**Important Conflict Resolution Rules:**
- **Keep BOTH**: Main's new features + your notification fixes
- **Never delete**: Code that only exists in main (new features)
- **Preserve**: Your notification fixes and improvements

**Common conflict markers:**
```
<<<<<<< HEAD (your branch)
Your notification code
=======
Main's new feature code
>>>>>>> main
```

**How to resolve:**
1. Open each conflicted file
2. Look for `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` markers
3. Decide what to keep:
   - If it's a new feature from main: KEEP IT
   - If it's your fix: KEEP IT
   - If both are needed: KEEP BOTH (combine them intelligently)
4. Remove the conflict markers
5. Save the file

**After resolving each file:**
```bash
# Mark the file as resolved
git add <filename>
```

**After ALL conflicts are resolved:**
```bash
# Complete the merge
git commit -m "merge: Merge main into fix/comment-notifications - resolved conflicts"
```

### Step 7: Test everything
```bash
# Make sure your Docker services still work
docker-compose up -d

# Test the notification features
# Test any new features from main
```

### Step 8: Push your updated feature branch
```bash
# Push your feature branch with all the merged changes
git push origin fix/comment-notifications

# If this is the first time pushing this branch:
git push -u origin fix/comment-notifications
```

### Step 9: Merge to main (final step)
```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Merge your feature branch (should be clean now, no conflicts)
git merge fix/comment-notifications

# Push to remote main
git push origin main
```

### Step 10: Cleanup (optional)
```bash
# Delete the local feature branch
git branch -d fix/comment-notifications

# Delete the remote feature branch
git push origin --delete fix/comment-notifications
```

## Common Conflict Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Import statements conflict
```python
<<<<<<< HEAD
from datetime import datetime, timezone, timedelta
=======
from datetime import datetime, timezone
>>>>>>> main
```
**Resolution**: Keep the more complete version (includes timedelta)
```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone, timedelta
```

### Scenario 2: New function added in main, you modified nearby code
**Resolution**: Keep BOTH - the new function AND your modifications

### Scenario 3: You fixed a bug, main has a new feature in same area
**Resolution**: Keep BOTH - your bug fix AND the new feature

## Emergency Rollback
If something goes wrong during the merge:

```bash
# If you're in the middle of a merge and want to cancel
git merge --abort

# If you already committed but want to undo
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# If you pushed and need to undo (BE CAREFUL!)
# Contact your team first before force pushing
```

## Need Help?
If you encounter complex conflicts, don't hesitate to:
1. Take screenshots of the conflict
2. Ask for help
3. Use `git diff` to understand what changed

**Remember**: It's better to ask than to accidentally delete important code!
