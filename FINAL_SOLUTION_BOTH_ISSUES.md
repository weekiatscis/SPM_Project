# Final Solution for Both Issues

## üî• URGENT: Issue #1 - No Comment Notifications

### What I Need From You Right Now

**Please run these commands and share the output:**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Watch logs
docker compose logs -f task-service | tee comment-test-logs.txt
```

Then in your browser:
1. Post a comment on ANY task
2. Let it run for 10 seconds
3. Press Ctrl+C to stop
4. Share the contents of `comment-test-logs.txt` with me

**Without seeing these logs, I cannot diagnose the problem.**

### What the Logs Will Tell Us

If you see:
- `üîî NOTIFY_TASK_COMMENT CALLED` ‚Üí Code is running ‚úÖ
- `‚ùå No stakeholders found` ‚Üí Collaboration issue
- `‚úÖ SUCCESS: Notification inserted!` ‚Üí Backend working, frontend issue
- NOTHING ‚Üí Docker has old code

## üí° Issue #2 - Collaborators Not Showing on Home Page

### Problem Analysis

Your debug output shows:
```javascript
collaborators: Array(2)  // Data exists!
```

But collaborators don't appear when you click task from home page.

### Root Cause

The `TaskDetailModal` component is checking `props.task.collaborators`, and if it exists, it fetches user details.

**Two possible causes:**

**Cause A: Collaborators field is empty array**
When task is clicked from home page, `props.task.collaborators = []`

**Cause B: Collaborators field is not parsed**
The collaborators might be a JSON string instead of an array

### Solution: Add Debug Logging

Let me add console logging to see what's being passed to the modal.
